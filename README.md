[DEPRECATED]

# REKKA

This is my experimental project about 4~5 years ago, it is similar to [Ejecta](https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta) or cocoonjs, but its main goal is to speed up the RPG Maker MV games.

I like RMMV very much, I also like mobile games. But, especially at that time, slightly complicated RMMV games did not run smoothly on mobile phones. For example, when I ran Moghunter's [Master Demo MV](https://atelierrgss.wordpress.com/download-page-mv-01/) on Xiaomi MI2S or MI3, I got <10 FPS on the map, even 1~3 FPS(MI3) in battle.

So I made this. It can run the RMMV games completely and correctly (neither Ejecta or cocoonjs). It have a significant performance improvement in windows, but the improvement is limited on Android.

## Prebuilt Demo

This demo has integrated Moghunter's [Master Demo MV](https://atelierrgss.wordpress.com/download-page-mv-01/) (An old version)
